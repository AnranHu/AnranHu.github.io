Welcome to my homepage!\n

I am an assistant professor in the [https://ieor.columbia.edu/ Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research]. I work at the intersection of stochastic control, game theory, optimization and machine learning. My current primary research areas are mean-field games, continuous-time stochastic control and reinforcement learning, and more recently FinTech and applying machine learning and reinforcement learning to finance. Before coming to Columbia University, I was a Hooke Research Fellow in the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford. I completed my Ph.D. in [https://ieor.berkeley.edu/ Berkeley IEOR], advised by [https://xinguo.ieor.berkeley.edu/ Prof. Xin Guo]. Before coming to Berkeley, I obtained my B.S. degree from [http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/ School of Mathematical Sciences], [https://english.pku.edu.cn/ Peking University].
